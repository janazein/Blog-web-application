# Blog-web-application
A blog web app using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. Users can create, view, edit and delete posts. No database is used, so posts donâ€™t persist after server restarts.

## Features

1. Post Creation: Users can create new blog posts with a title, author, and content.
2. Post Viewing: The home page displays all existing posts for easy reading.
3. Post Update/Delete: Users can edit or delete posts as needed.
4. Styling: Responsive design ensures usability on both desktop and mobile devices.


## Technical Requirements

- Node.js & Express.js: The backend is powered by Node.js with Express.js handling routing and middleware.
- EJS: The templating engine used to render dynamic HTML pages based on application data.
- CSS: Custom styles provide a modern and user friendly interface.
